            Hello, I am Arslan Mumtaz, a software engineering student at FAST-NUCES. I completed my FSC from APS and
            College. With over 2 years of experience in web development and UI/UX design, I have completed multiple
            projects in different languages, including Python, C++, Java, and C# .NET. I am also the Brand Ambassador
            for Paklaunch, and I have experience as IT head for my university society, IEEE. I am a general member of
            GDSC and have contributed to NUTEC KP's biggest Olympiad.

            Currently, I am enrolled as an intern in Data Science and Business Analytics at The Sparks Foundation. I am
            passionate about my work and always eager to learn and expand my knowledge. My key skills include web
            development, UI/UX design, data analysis, and problem-solving. In my free time, I enjoy reading books,
            playing football, and volunteering for various social causes.

            If you would like to know more about me or my work, please don't hesitate to contact me.
        </p>
